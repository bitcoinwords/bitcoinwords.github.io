WORDS PrtSc is a screenshot worth of signal. This is a new part of the WORDS project dedicated to explaining an idea in a single screenshot. They say if you can't explain something clearly in a screenshot, then you don't understand it well enough. 

This was inspired by [Screenshot Essays](https://twitter.com/ericstromberg/status/1283909856735395843) by Eric Stromberg.
