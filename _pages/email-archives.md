This archive looks crazy, I know. Journals are being created out of chronological order since we are archiving backwards too. I am also trying different headlines so there's no standardized subject on the emails. This is a work in progress and I appreciate your subscription. 

If you are feeling generous and find value in this project, <strike>consider making a donation</strike> buying me a beer.
